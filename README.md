Hi, I'm James. This page is where I publish lots of different ideas. I work in mainly in JavaScript, PHP, Go. And I like to use React and Laravel. I also do some WordPress tweaking.

Right now I'm currently working on my deliverpix application, you can see it currently live [here](https://deliverpix.com "deliverpix").
