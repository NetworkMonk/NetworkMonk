I solve problems! A web application developer and technology leader living in the UK.

I've worked in technology for nearly 20 years. Although personally, I started coding at 9! Having worked in lots of different areas and roles, I'm very happy with my breadth of knowledge and wide skill set. I've always consciously made the effort to be able to understand a technology solution from the very beginning to end, to be able to support with the implementation and support it after release.
